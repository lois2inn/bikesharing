# BIKE SHARING

NY Citibike with Tableau

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis

After a trip to NYC and using citibikes there, a data analyst creates a proposal to start a similar bike business in Des Moines. The project focusses on learning how the bike share business works in NYC by reviewing Citibike data in August 2019. The results will then be shared with potential investors in Des Moines. Tableau is used to create visualizations of the below tasks:
- Determine the total trips taken in August 2019.
- Find the proportion of short term customers to annual subscribers.
- Determine the peak usage hours for the month of August.
- Find the top starting and ending locations.
- Determine the gender breakdown of active riders.
- Find the average duration of a bike ride, by age.
- Determine bike utilization and bikes due for repair.
- Determine the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- Find the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- Find the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

#### Visualizations explained

1. With a total of 2,344,224 trips in August 2019, there is much data to visualize. As per the image below, 80% of the users areÂ Subscribers, who make regular use of the bikes and are a predictable source of income for the program. The data also shows that 65% of total bike users are predominantly males followed by females at 25%.

#### Additional visualizations for future analysis:
- There is a need to understand why the dark colored locations in the below visualization are so popular. Are they close to ferries or subways or workplaces? Understanding the nature of these locations is crucial for establishing bike locations in Des Moines. It would also help to look at how far do bikers travel and which stations are most popular.

- The start and stop locations for bike rides can also be analyzed based on gender. A closer examination of the station locations might provide clarity on why more women aren't using the bike-share program.

- The distance covered in a trip can be studied along with duration and subscription costs to get a better picture of why users prefer bikes compared to other transport.
