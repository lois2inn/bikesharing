# BIKE SHARING
NY Citibike with Tableau

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis
After a trip to NYC and using citibikes there, a data analyst creates a proposal to start a similar bike business in Des Moines. The project focusses on learning how the bike share business works in Des Moines while reviewing the NYC Citibike data in August 2019. Below are the visualizations created from the Citibike trip data using Tableau:



## Results
- at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis
- a description of the results for each visualization

## Summary
- high-level summary of the results
 Target bike repairs during nonpeak hours
 Target male population as they will more likely prefer biking shown in August bike trip data.
 Push for subscription
 
 
Two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis
- More insight into why certain starting and ending locations have more number of bikes. 
One reason could be areas of interest (tourism) along Hudson River. Tourism group would be customers instead of subscribers.
- Why do some locations away from the main city center show bike usage? (start locations at north of boroughs) and start/end locations at west of manhattan? could be the proximity to subway and bike to workplace or bike long distance to work. This group would mostly be subscribers.
