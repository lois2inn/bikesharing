# BIKE SHARING

NY Citibike with Tableau

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis

After a trip to NYC and using citibikes there, a data analyst creates a proposal to start a similar bike business in Des Moines. The project focusses on learning how the bike share business works in NYC by reviewing Citibike data in August 2019. The results will then be shared with potential investors in Des Moines. Tableau is used to create visualizations of the below tasks:
- Determine the total trips taken in August 2019.
- Find the proportion of short term customers to annual subscribers.
- Determine the peak usage hours for the month of August.
- Find the top starting and ending locations.
- Determine the gender breakdown of active riders.
- Find the average duration of a bike ride, by age.
- Determine bike utilization and bikes due for repair.
- Determine the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- Find the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- Find the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

#### Visualizations explained

1. With a total of 2,344,224 trips in August 2019, there is much data to visualize. As per the image below, 80% of the users areÂ Subscribers, who make regular use of the bikes and are a predictable source of income for the program. The data also shows that 65% of total bike users are predominantly males followed by females at 25%.

2. The below dashboard shows that the peak hours in August are 7AM-10AM and 4PM-8PM. The bike usage is across all ages, however teenagers and youngsters use more. The bike utilization visual shows the bikes used in the most popular areas. A bike repair plan can be put accordingly.

## Summary

- high-level summary of the results
 Target bike repairs during nonpeak hours
 Target male population as they will more likely prefer biking shown in August bike trip data.
 Push for subscription
 
 
Two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis
- Trip length
- Understand the nature of start and end locations to determine the popularity of bike usage.
  proximity to ferry, subway to get to work.
  tourist spots along Hudson River. Tourism group would be customers instead of subscribers.
  
  
- Why do some locations away from the main city center show bike usage? (start locations at north of boroughs) and start/end locations at west of manhattan? could be the proximity to subway and bike to workplace or bike long distance to work. This group would mostly be subscribers.
